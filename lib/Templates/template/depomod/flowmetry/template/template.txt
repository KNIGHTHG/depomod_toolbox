#template flow file for regularly spaced data
#replace all entries that start with #Replace with...(do not replace these entries #startOfDataMarker and #endOfDataMarker)
#save the file in the flowmetry directory with the same name as the project with extension depomodflowmetryproperties (e.g somewhereOnSea.depomodflowmetryproperties)
Flowmetry.deltaT=#Replace with sampling period
Flowmetry.lengthUnitsSiConversionFactor=1.0
Flowmetry.meterDepths=#Replace with comma separated list of meter depths (positive upwards) in depth order starting at the deepest position e.g. -25.00,-15.00,-3.00
Flowmetry.neapSpringNeapStartSample=#Replace with start sample for spring neap spring cycle
Flowmetry.numberOfTimeSteps=#Replace with number of samples
Flowmetry.siteDepth=#Replace with depth of site (positive upwards) e.g. -28
Flowmetry.siteTide=#Replace with site tide
Flowmetry.siteXCoordinate=#Replace with easting reference to sample site this is assumed to be in same coordinate reference system as bathymetry
Flowmetry.siteYCoordinate=#Replace with westing reference to sample site this is assumed to be in same coordinate reference system as bathymetry
Flowmetry.springNeapSpringStartSample=#Replace with start sample for neap spring neap cycle
Flowmetry.timeUnitsSiConversionFactor=1.0

#startOfDataMarker
#Replace with Comma Separated flow data. The first entry on each line is sample number starting at 0, then subsequent entries are pairs of U and V velocity in meters per second start with deepest meter the total number of pairs of columns should match the number of entries in Flowmetry.meterDepths e.g. 0.00000,0.0556357,-0.0275876,-0.0102418,-0.0813579,0.0173237,-0.0705028
